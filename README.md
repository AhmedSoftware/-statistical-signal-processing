Time synchronization is divided into two phases: 

a) Frame synchronization or coarse time synchronization: The task of frame synchronization makes it possible to estimate the beginning of a frame by the use of a preamble. 

b) Symbol synchronization or fine time synchronization: The symbol synchronization task is used to identify the beginning of the OFDM symbol in a bit stream. Symbol synchronization consists of positioning the FFT window on the received sample stream.
